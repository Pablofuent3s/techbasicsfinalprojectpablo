## Pablo FuentesÂ´ Tech Basics 1 Final Project github repository
This is a keyboard pygame that I wanted to improve from the assignment on week 9.

Title: Reflex Drive. 

Use the keys up, down, left and right to get the car to meet the green cube!


This is a kind of simulation when you have your introductory test for your driving license, when they test your reflex response when you detect a collision.
#### Installation
Duplicate this github repository to your local machine to make sure you have all the media necessary to run the game.


Install required Python Version:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Usage
I tried to keep it simple, so you just need to use one Python file!
```
python titlegame.py
```
